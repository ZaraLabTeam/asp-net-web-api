HTTP is not just for serving up web pages. It is also a powerful 
platform for building APIs that expose services and data. 
HTTP is simple, flexible, and ubiquitous. Almost any platform that 
you can think of has an HTTP library, so HTTP services can reach a 
broad range of clients, including browsers, mobile devices, and 
traditional desktop applications.
